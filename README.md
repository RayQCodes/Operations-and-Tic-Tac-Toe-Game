Tic Tac Toe Game

 1. To play you must have node installed on your computer and do this by doing for cmd : node -v
   2. Once Node is successfully installed please use command Node tictactoe.js command to run the game and once that goes on game should work
3. You win by getting three objects in a row and one of them is a goat and one is a grape, The Spacing of where the object goes is also tracked using numbers from 0-9 with 0 in the very first slot to 9 being in the very last slot
   4. You can also quit once done by pressing q , and once game is done the winner will be shown and printed on the terminal


   Also the other files are just practice files in which I practiced different operations that can be done using javascript and tried my best to use some of that knowledge into the tic tac toe project.
